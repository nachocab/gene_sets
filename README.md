This is my list of curated gene sets. Feel free to use it, expand it and share it.

I use the [yaml R package](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/yaml/index.html) to deal with yaml files. They are convenient because they let me add comments next to each gene, and nest them in a hierarchy.

Let me know if you think this is useful. I'm considering implementing a simple webapp to access this kind of content. You can contact me at nacho@bu.edu
